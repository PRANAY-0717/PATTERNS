error - 1(RETURNING A NULL CHARACTER WHILE USING THE INPUT WINDOW AGAIN)

Certainly! The issue was caused by the way Scanner handles input. When using nextInt(), it reads only the integer value and leaves the newline character ('\n') in the input buffer. This leftover newline character causes the next call to nextLine() to immediately return an empty string, which can cause unexpected behavior in your program.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step explanation of the fix:

Reading the integer size input:

java
Copy code
int siz = as.nextInt();
This reads an integer from the input, but it does not consume the newline character that is entered when the user presses Enter.
Consuming the leftover newline character:

java
Copy code
as.nextLine(); // Consume the leftover newline character
This nextLine() call consumes the newline character left in the input buffer by the previous nextInt() call. Without this, the subsequent nextLine() calls would read the leftover newline instead of waiting for new user input.
Continuing with normal input processing:

Now, the input buffer is clear, and the program can continue reading new inputs correctly.
Example:
Without the Fix:

java
Copy code
int siz = as.nextInt();
// User enters 5 and presses Enter.
// `nextInt()` reads the 5, but leaves the newline character in the buffer.
// The next `nextLine()` call will immediately return an empty string.
With the Fix:

java
Copy code
int siz = as.nextInt();
as.nextLine(); // Consume the leftover newline character
// Now, the input buffer is clear.
// The next `nextLine()` call will correctly wait for new user input.
By adding as.nextLine(); after as.nextInt();, the program correctly handles the newline character and waits for the next line of input as expected, thus fixing the issue with unexpected empty strings being read.
