Hello everyone,

I'm Pranay Jaiswal, the developer behind this code. As a 17-year-old who’s new to the world of coding, I’m excited to share my first-ever project with you! Currently, I’m awaiting my college journey, which is just 1 months away. Before I embark on this new chapter, I wanted to get a head start by learning and creating something that could give me an edge in today’s competitive world.

This project is my initial foray into coding, and I truly hope you find it enjoyable and valuable. Your feedback would mean a lot to me as I continue to grow and learn in this field.

Thank you for checking it out!
